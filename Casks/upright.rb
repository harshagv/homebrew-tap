  caveats <<~EOS
    Upright is a menu-bar agent (no Dock icon) and is ad-hoc signed (no Apple
    Developer ID). If macOS reports it "cannot be opened because the developer
    cannot be verified" or that it is "damaged", clear the quarantine flag once:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/Upright.app"

    Then open Upright from Launchpad/Spotlight; it appears in the menu bar.
    Real posture detection needs AirPods Pro/3/Max or Beats Fit Pro.
